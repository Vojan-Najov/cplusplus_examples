Adding Resources to Project File

For the text file to appear when you run the application, you must specify the resource file as a source file in the CMakeLists.txt file that the wizard created for you:

set(PROJECT_SOURCES
        main.cpp
        textfinder.cpp
        textfinder.h
        textfinder.ui
        ${TS_FILES}
        textfinder.qrc
)
